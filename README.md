Hi, My Name is Jonel E. Capa. Graduated with a degree in BS Industrial Technology majoring in Electronics from Marikina Polytechnic College. Currently employed at Fiberhome Phils., Inc. as Operation Staff.

My hobbies is playing mobile games, cooking, walking, and troubleshooting computers/laptops.

My goal for this year is to learn a lot in the web development course.

I want to be a web developer because I always access the website in my current work. I want to learn a lot about how to make a website and I want to raise my income and make a career shift in my current position. Being a website developer is challenging to gain experience and provide quality websites to meet client satisfaction.
